# Skyheim - Valheim Magic
Skyheim
Skyheim is a magic mod aimed at providing balanced progression and a reason to go back and slay bosses. Each boss drops a crafting ingredient that can be used to craft and upgrade runes that will allow you to cast a variety of spells both beneficial and destructive. Along with boss drops you'll also require some items that can be found in dungeons, giving you incentive to seek them out as well.

In addition to the spells themselves Skyheim adds Mana as a resource and a persistant cooldown system.

## Installation
Extract skyheim.dll to /BepInEx/plugins folder.

## Crafting
Collecting materials from bosses and dungeons will allow you to craft and upgrade each rune.
