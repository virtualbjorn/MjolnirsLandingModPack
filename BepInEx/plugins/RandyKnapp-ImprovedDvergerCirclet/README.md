# Improved Dverger Circlet
##### by RandyKnapp
Changes the color of the light emitted by the Dverger circlet to white. Adds several beam width options, and a pool of radiance (point light) option.

Press "[" (left bracket) to narrow the beam and "]" (right bracket) to widen the beam. At maximum width, the beam turns into a point light centered on the player. Hotkeys, beam color, and beam values are all configurable.
