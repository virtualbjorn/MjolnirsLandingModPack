# No Tool Delay for Valheim

Allows the player to eat whenever they want and not just when their food items are going to run out.

Rather than waiting for consumables to run out, Let Me Eat allows you to refresh your food buffs whenever you want!

## Installation (manual):
Place the LetMeEat folder into the Valheim\BepInEx\plugins folder.
